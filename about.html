        I'm a 3rd-year student currently attending California State University Fullerton.<br>
        At first, I wasn’t sure which path I wanted to take, but after spending some time learning on my own, I found my passion for web development.

            For me, going to school was always a challenge. The first time I attended college, I planned to major in business, but things didn’t work out, so I decided to leave and focus on working until 2021. That year, I decided to go back to school, but this time with a fresh start. Switching my major to computer science has given me more motivation than ever to finish my degree.

            When I'm not busy with school, I have a few hobbies that I like to dive into.
            I’m an active gamer and enjoy playing a variety of games, whether they’re FPS, RPG, or something more casual. Right now, my main game is MapleStory. Outside of gaming, I enjoy photography and shoot in both digital and film formats, experimenting with small and medium formats. Occasionally, you can also catch me watching web development tutorials on YouTube to learn something new.
