        I'm a 3rd year student currently diving into the world front-end web development.<br>
        Before I wasn't sure on the path that I wanted to take, but after doing a little learning on my own. I've decided that I wanted to create websites. I am actively learning more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript!

        For me, going to school was always hard. The first time I attended college I planned to major in business. That didn't work out though so I ended up leaving and just working for the time being until 2021.
        I ended up going back to school, but this time it would be different. Switching over my major to computer science I am now more motivated than ever to finish my degree.

        When I'm not busy with school I have a few hobbies that I like to dive into. <br>
        I am an active gamer, I play a variety of games whether they are FPS, RPG, or anything casual. At the moment though my main game I play is MapleStory.<br>
        Outside of being on the computer I enjoy photography. I shoot in both digital and film, and small or medium format.
        Occasionally you can also catch me watching some web development tutorials on YouTube.
